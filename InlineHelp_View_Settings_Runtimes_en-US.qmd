### Runtimes

To configure *Studies* that use *CBA ItemBuilder* content with the *IRTLib Editor*, the appropriate runtime environment (*Runtime*) is required for each version. Current tested versions of the *CBA ItemBuilder* *runtime* are already stored in the *IRTLib Editor*, but *runtimes* for other versions of the *CBA ItemBuilder* or updated or corrected *runtimes* can also be imported into the *IRTLib Editor* in this section.


#### Check CBA ItemBuilder Version

It is important to know which version of the CBA ItemBuilder was used to create the items (i.e. the CBA ItemBuilder project files). If in doubt, this information can be found in the *About dialogue* of the CBA ItemBuilder, for example:

* Step 1: Open the "Apout" dialogue via the "Help" menu

> ![](img/screenshot-ib-version-01.png){width="300" fig-align="left"}

* Step 2: Search for the version number in the dialogue (here `9.9.0`)

> ![](img/screenshot-ib-version-02.png){width="300" fig-align="left"}

The version number must be listed as one of the cards in the *Settings* of the *IRTlib Editor* in the *Runtimes* section:

> ![](img/screenshot-ib-version-03.png){width="300" fig-align="left"}

#### Import runtime files

If the corresponding runtime is not already included in the Editor, a new/additional *runtime* can be imported. Study configurations that are created/edited with the *IRTlib Editor* can contain several *Runtimes* for different versions.

* Step 1: To integrate a runtime, a JavaScript and a CSS file are required. These files can be downloaded here:

<a href="https://cba.itembuilder.de/appendix-tables.html#previous-versions" target="_new">https://cba.itembuilder.de/appendix-tables.html#previous-versions</a>

* Step 2: Unzip the downloaded *Runtime* to be used. 

* Step 3: Navigate to the *Runtimes* section:

> ![](img/screenshot-import-runtime-01-DEU.png){width="300" fig-align="left"}

* Step 4: Press the "+" button (bottom right)

* Step 5: Enter the version number with three digits (e.g. 9.9.0):

> ![](img/screenshot-import-runtime-02-DEU.png){width="300" fig-align="left"}

* Step 6: Select the file `main.*.js` from the ZIP archive containing the runtime environment. Note that the * corresponds to the hash of the file (i.e. the full file name looks like `main.19479ac3.js`)


* Step 7: Select the file `main.*.css` from the ZIP archive containing the runtime. Note that the * corresponds to the hash of the file (i.e. the full file name looks like `main.b765ceca.css`)

> Note: The *Description* field and the two additional *Map files* (for JavaScript Source and for CSS Source) are optional.

* Step 8: Press the *Save* button to finalise the import of the *Runtime*:

> ![](img/screenshot-import-runtime-03-DEU.png){width="300" fig-align="left"}

After the import, the supported CBA ItemBuilder versions are listed in the *Runtime* section. To delete a *Runtime* for a specific version, click on the *Trash* icon at the bottom right of the "Map" and confirm with *Delete*.
