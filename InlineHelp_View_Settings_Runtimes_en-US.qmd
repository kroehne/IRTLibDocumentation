### Runtimes

To use the IRTLib Editor for configuring studies that use CBA ItemBuilder content, the appropriate runtime environment (*Runtime*) is required for that version. Current tested versions of the CBA ItemBuilder runtime are already stored in the Editor, but runtimes for other versions of the CBA ItemBuilder or updated or corrected runtimes can also be imported into the Editor in this section.

#### Check CBA ItemBuilder Version

You need to know which version of the CBA ItemBuilder was used to prepare the items (i.e., the CBA ItemBuilder project files). If you are in doubt, this information can be found, for instance, in the *About Dialog* of the CBA ItemBuilder:

* Step 1: Open the “About”-dialog using the “Help”-menu

> ![](img/screenshot-ib-version-01.png){width="300"}

* Step 2: Find the version number in the dialog (here `9.9.0`)

> ![](img/screenshot-ib-version-02.png){width="300"} 

> The version number must be listed as one of the cards shown in the section *Runtimes* of the *IRTlib Editor*'s *Settings*:

> ![](img/screenshot-ib-version-03.png){width="300"} 

#### Import Runtime Files

If the appropriate runtime is not already included in the editor, a new/additional *Runtime* can be imported. Study configurations created/edited with the *IRTlib Editor* can contain multiple *Runtimes* for different versions.

* Step 1: To integrate a runtime, a JavaScript and a CSS file are required. These files can be downloaded here:

> <a href="https://cba.itembuilder.de/appendix-tables.html#previous-versions" target="_new">https://cba.itembuilder.de/appendix-tables.html#previous-versions</a>

* Step 2: Unzip the downloaded *Runtime* that should be used. 

* Step 3: Navigate to the section *Runtimes*:

> ![](img/screenshot-import-runtime-01-DEU.png){width="300"} 

* Step 4: Push the button “+” (bottom right)

* Step 5: Enter the version number with three places (e.g., 9.9.0):

> ![](img/screenshot-import-runtime-02-DEU.png){width="300"} 

* Step 6: Select the file `main.*.js` from the ZIP archive that contains the runtime. Note that the * equals the hash of the file (i.e., the complete file name looks like `main.19479ac3.js`)

* Step 7: Select the file `main.*.css` from the ZIP archive that contains the runtime. Note that the * equals the hash of the file (i.e., the complete file name looks like `main.b765ceca.css`)

> Note: The field *Description* and the additional two *Map-Files* (for JavaScript Source and for CSS Source) are optional.

* Step 8: Press the button *Save* to complete the import of the *Runtime*:

> ![](img/screenshot-import-runtime-03-DEU.png){width="300"} 

After importing the supported CBA ItemBuilder versions are listed in the section *Runtime*. To delete a *Runtime* for a particular version, click the *Trash* icon on the bottom right of the “card” and confirm with *Delete*.
