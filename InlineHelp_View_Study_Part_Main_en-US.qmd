### Create Survey Part

The *IRTLib Editor* is used to create configurations for *Studies*, which can then be used in an *IRTLib Player* to carry out computer-based assessments. *Studies* consist of one or more *Survey Parts*. 

#### How does it work?

Once a *Study* has been created, a *Survey Part* can now be added via the plus icon at the bottom right:

Then enter a *Name* and optionally a *Description* in the **Create new Survey Part** dialogue.

Make sure that only letters (upper and lower case), numbers and a `_` are allowed for the *name*.

Then click on *Save*.

If required, you can also assign an image to a *survey part* using the following icon. This image is used in the *IRTLib Editor* for this *Survey Part*:

#### Edit Survey Part

Created *survey parts* are displayed as tiles in the survey part overview:

* To continue with the configuration of a *survey part*, click on the small edit icon:

* **Delete survey section**: You can also use the recycle bin icon to delete *survey parts*. The deletion of *survey parts* cannot be undone:

#### Sort survey parts

If the option *Enable Routing for Survey Parts* is not selected in the *Info* view (section *Overview*) in the configuration of a *Study*, then *Survey Parts* are administered in the order in which they are displayed in the survey part administration.

* **Move Survey Parts**: To change the order of *Survey Parts* using drag-and-drop, the *Change Order* mode must first be activated using the following toggle icon:

> The tiles can then be put in the desired order. The *Change Order* mode is ended when the disc icon is clicked or the changes are discarded:
