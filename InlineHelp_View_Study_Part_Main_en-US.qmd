### Create survey part

The *IRTLib Editor* is used to create configurations for *studies*, which can then be used in an *IRTLib Player* to carry out computer-based assessments. *Studies* consist of one or more *assessment parts*. 

#### How does it work?

Once a *study* has been created, a *survey section* can now be added via the plus icon at the bottom right:

Then enter a *name* and optionally a *description* in the **Create new survey part** dialog.

Make sure that only letters (upper and lower case), numbers and a `_` are allowed for the *Name*.


Then click on *Save*.

If required, you can also assign an image to a *survey part* using the following icon. This image is used in the *IRTLib Editor* for this survey part:

#### Edit survey part

Created *survey parts* are displayed as tiles in the survey part overview:

* To continue with the configuration of a *survey part*, click on the small edit icon:

**Delete survey section**: You can also use the recycle bin icon to delete *survey parts*. The deletion of *survey parts* cannot be undone:

#### Sort survey parts

If the option *Enable routing for survey parts* is not selected in the *Info* view (section *Overview*) in the configuration of a *Study*, then *Survey parts* are administered in the order in which they are displayed in the survey part administration.

* Move survey parts**: To change the order of *survey parts* using drag-and-drop, the *Change order* mode must first be activated using the following toggle icon:

> The tiles can then be put in the desired order. The *Change order* mode is ended when the floppy disk icon is clicked or the changes are discarded:
