### Study Preparation with Offline Editor

The *IRTlib Editor* for offline use is provided as a ZIP archive (e.g. `TestApp.Editor.Desktop.zip`), which must be unpacked. After unpacking the editor, the application `TestApp.Editor.Desktop.exe` can be started on a Windows device.

The sections [Preparation > Overview](preparation-overview.qmd), [Preparation > Studies](preparation-studies.qmd) and [Preparation > Survey parts](preparation-parts.qmd) document how to prepare and configure data surveys with the help of *CBA ItemBuilder* items.

### Study Execution with Offline Player 

The *IRTlib Player* is also available as a Windows application for offline use and is provided as a ZIP archive (e.g. `TestApp.Player.Desktop.zip`). After unpacking the *IRTlib Player*, a published study configuration is required that is to be used for data collection.  

After adding the contents of a published study provided as study configuration, the executable file `TestApp.Player.Desktop.exe` can be started (either with or without start parameters). 

**Kiosk Mode**: The *IRTlib Player* can be used directly for data collection via the executable file `TestApp.Player.Desktop.exe` on the computer on which it is run locally. The *Study* can be configured so that it is displayed in a *Kiosk Mode* on one screen and can only be terminated via the *Task Manager* or the *Test Manager Menu* (see *Full Screen Mode* in the section [Configuration for display](preparation-studies.html#configuration-for-display)).

**Local server**: The *IRTlib Player* can also be run as a local server. After starting the program `TestApp.Player.Server.exe`, a configured *Study* can also be delivered via *Webbrowser* or other browsers with *Kiosk Mode* (e.g. the [Safe Exam Browser](https://safeexambrowser.org/)). With this configuration, data can be collected, for example, in schools without an Internet connection but with a notebook that acts as a *bring-in* server.

The sections [Data collection > Overview](data-collection-overview.qmd), [Data collection > Publish & export](data-collection-publish-and-export.qmd) and [Data collection > Integration & delivery](data-collection-player-integration.qmd) document how data collection can be carried out using the *IRTlib Player* in the various constellations. 

## Online (Docker)

The *IRTlib* software (*IRTlib Editor* and *IRTlib Player*) for online use can be obtained as a *Docker* container. An example can be found at <https://github.com/DIPFtba/IRTlibDeploymentSoftware>. 

To use the Docker container, it is recommended to check out the repository on the target device (requires git) and run the command `./start.sh` in the `docker` folder (requires installed `docker` and `docker compose`) to start the software.

If nothing is changed in the `docker-compose.yml` file, the editor is accessible via port *8002* and the player software via port *8001*.

See the section [Data collection > Integration & delivery](data-collection-player-integration.qmd) for more information on using the *Docker* containers.
