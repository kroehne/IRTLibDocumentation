*IRTlib* is a software for the delivery of computer-based tests. The software consists of two components:

- *IRTLib Editor*: A software for *test authors*, which is used to configure *Studies*.
- *IRTlib Player*: A software for *data collections*, with which *target persons* work on tasks that are configured in the form of a *Study*.

Instructions for installing and setting up both programmes for initial use can be found under [Download & Installation](download.qmd).

Before using the *IRTlib Software* to configure and create deliveries, the assessment content (tasks, instructions, intermediate screens, etc.) must be created in the form of individual *Tasks* using the *CBA ItemBuilder*. 

* The *CBA ItemBuilder* can be downloaded here: [www.itembuilder.de/software](https://www.itembuilder.de/software)

* An interactive documentation of the *CBA ItemBuilder* is available here: [cba.itembuilder.de](https://cba.itembuilder.de)

For the use of the *IRTlib software*, a context-sensitive [program help](preparation-overview.qmd#embedded-program-help) is stored directly in the application. The documentation with the embedded help is available online on this page and is also available as [PDF](IRTlib-Documentation.pdf).

The development of the *CBA ItemBuilder* and the *IRTlib Software* is coordinated by the *Centre for Technology-Based Assessment ([TBA](https://tba.dipf.de/de/ueber-tba/))* at the *[DIPF](https://www.dipf.de/)* | *Leibniz Institute for Research and Information in Education*.
