### Publish

Before a *Version* of a *Study* is published, the *Validate* button can be used to check whether the *Study* has been configured correctly.

Note: If no errors are found during *Validation*, no further message is displayed and the study can be published. 

If there are no more errors and the *Study* is to be prepared for export, a *Version* can be created. The following button is used for this purpose:
