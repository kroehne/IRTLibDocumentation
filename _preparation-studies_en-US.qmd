Configurations that are created with the *IRTlib editor* are summarized in so-called *studies*. A *study* is intended to summarize the assessment content that is administered in a survey or session. 

## Study administration

After starting the *IRTlib Editor*, the *Studies* view is displayed. In this view, the first step to prepare a new configuration is to **add a new study**:

{{< video https://youtu.be/7VKf6U3oeM4 >}}

The created *studies* appear as cards in the *Studies* view. Note that the order in which the studies are displayed in the *Study view* does not matter. 

Detailed instructions on how to create a *study* can be found here in the embedded help:

## Basic configurations

The configurations of a particular study, including <a href="publish-and-export.html">versioning and publishing</a>, are managed within studies (i.e. after opening a study for editing by clicking on the edit icon at the bottom right of the card).

Created studies that are displayed in the *IRTlib Editor* in the *Studies* view can be opened for editing.

## Access to studies (login)

The *IRTlib software* supports various ways in which people (test participants, respondents, ...) can authenticate themselves for an assessment. The configurations include two aspects: 

* *Login mode*: Is access required (login, login+password, passphrases/token) or not? And if credentials are required, what are *valid values*?
* *Login source*: How is the login information retrieved (direct input on the platform, CBA ItemBuilder item, ....) or passed (login parameter or call parameter)?

Detailed information on the configuration of the login of a *study* can be found here in the embedded help:

## Display of assessment content 

*Studies* can define how the *CBA ItemBuilder* content is to be displayed. The settings in the *Display* section can relate to the scaling and alignment of the content as well as the behavior of the *IRTlib Player* application. 

Detailed information on configuring the *Display* of a *Study* can be found here in the embedded help:

## Menu for test administrators 

If the execution of assessments is accompanied by test administrators or interviewers, functions can be defined password-protected for test administrators. 

::: callout-warning
Even if you do not need the functionality of a test administrator menu to carry out your data collection, you should still define a test administrator menu if you plan to collect data offline with the *IRTlib Player*. This is the only way to ensure that you can exit the application without the Task Manager (and without possible data loss) in the event of unforeseen events.

## Completion of surveys

For the integration of assessments into external processes, it is possible to configure how to proceed after processing the assessment content in a *session*, i.e. what will happen at the *end of the session*.
