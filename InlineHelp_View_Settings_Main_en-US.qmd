### Settings

In this section, settings can be made that affect working with the *IRTlib Editor* and all studies.

#### Runtime Management

To configure studies that use CBA ItemBuilder content with the IRTLib Editor, the appropriate runtime environment (*Runtime*) is required for each version. Current tested versions of the CBA ItemBuilder runtime are already stored in the Editor, but runtimes for other versions of the CBA ItemBuilder or updated or corrected runtimes can also be imported into the Editor in this section.

Runtimes that are available in the Editor are automatically integrated as part of the study configuration when studies are published and are thus available to the *IRTLib Player*.

#### General Settings

Change the language for the editor in this section. The setting selected here has no influence on the language of the assessment content in the configured studies.
