### Define Time Limit

*Survey Parts* without *Routing* can easily contain a time-limited section. To do this, the option *Restrict Item Time* is activated in the *Time Limit* view and a time limit in seconds (>0) is entered. 

Four groups of *CBA ItemBuilder* *Tasks* are distinguished for a time limit, which are defined in different places in the *IRTlib Editor*. The items for which the time limit is to apply are defined in the *Items* view (analogue to non-time-limited *Survey Parts*): 

* **Items**: Items that are displayed until the time limit has been reached.

In the *Time Limit* view, the following can also be defined:

* **Timeout Items**: Items that are only displayed if the time-limited items have not been completed within the limited processing time.

Finally, the following tasks can be defined as individual views of the configuration of *survey items*:

* **Prologue Items**: Items that are displayed before the time-limited section. 
* **Epilog items**: Items that are displayed after the time-limited section. 

The icons for the following operations are available in all the above dialogues:

* Add: ![](img/screenshot-add-project-plus-icon.png){width="40"}
* Refresh: ![](img/screenshot-update-item-icon-01.png){width="40"}
* Preview: ![](img/screenshot-preview-icon-01.png){width="40"}
* Download/Export: ![](img/screenshot-download-item-icon-01.png){width="40"}
* Delete: ![](img/screenshot-delete-item-icon-01.png){width="40"}
* Sort: ![](img/screenshot-sort-items-icon-01.png){width="80"}

Note: More complex designs with several timers can be implemented with the *IRTlib Editor* if the option *Enable Routing* is activated in the overview view for a *Survey Part*. 

Note: Changes to the *Time Limit* view must be saved using the disc symbol or discarded using the undo symbol:
