### Display settings 


Selected options are available for configuring the display, which relate to the presentation of the assessment content and the use of *CBA ItemBuilder* content, which is created with a defined aspect ratio (width and height).#### Window mode 


In the **Window mode** selection, you can configure whether an additional window is displayed in the *IRTlib Player*. The configuration is implemented differently depending on the environment: 


* *Window*:In this *window mode*, a regular program window is used in the offline *IRTlib Player*, in the online *IRTlib Player* the assessment content is displayed in the normal browser area, and the address bar and navigation buttons of the browser are visible in this mode.

* *Full screen*:The offline *IRTlib Player* starts directly in full screen mode if this option is configured.This is also associated with a *Kiosk mode*, i.e. access to other programs and the (accidental) termination of the program is only possible via the *Task Manager*.If a test administrator, for example, is to be able to end the test, a *Test administrator menu* must be configured. 


> The online *IRlLib Player* can also display assessment content in full-screen mode if this option is selected.If full screen mode is exited in the browser, the assessment content is then hidden.As it is not possible to automatically switch to full-screen mode in a browser, the target person first sees the following message from the platform:


> ![](img/screenshot-irtlib-player-message-fullscreen-not-started-DEU.png){width="80%"}


> By clicking on the button *Activate full screen* the full screen mode is started and the assessment content is then displayed without window frames and navigation areas of the browser.For a short time, the browser then typically displays a message that the full screen mode can be ended again with `Esc`.

> Note that this function is only available in browsers that support full screen mode (especially on older mobile devices, full screen mode is not fully supported; see for details e.g. on [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/?search=fullscreen)).


* *Full screen, if supported*:In this mode, the assessment in the online *IRTlib Player* is only displayed in full-screen mode if the browser supports full-screen mode.  However, the content of the computer-based assessment is displayed in windowed mode when a study is delivered online and a browser that does not support full screen mode is used.For the *IRlLib Player* offline, this configuration is identical to *full screen*.

* *Debug*:This mode allows access to the browser's developer tools during test execution, which are intended for debugging by software developers.


> If the offline *IRTlib Player* is started with a study that has the *Debug* entry configured as *Fixed mode*, the so-called developer tools (*DevTools*) can be called up via the right mouse button during the task presentation.> ![](img/screenshot-debug-view-dev-tools-example-01.png){width="80%"}
 
### Scaling and alignment


Assessment content created with the *CBA ItemBuilder* is created for a specific size in pixels (width times height).The content can then be scaled for display on devices with different screen sizes and screen resolutions.In the *CBA ItemBuilder*, the options under *Scaling Options* are therefore available in the *Preview*: 


> ![](img/screenshot-cba-itembuilder-preview-scaling-mode-01.png){width="200"}
 
Analog settings can be made in the *IRTlib Editor*.
 
**Scaling**: Setting how content should be adjusted if the available space and size of the items differ (*Scaling Mode*). 


  - None*:The content is displayed without adaptation to the available window or screen size (corresponds to `None`).
  - Scale up*:Content is enlarged so that the available space is utilized (corresponds to `Up`).
  - downscale*: Content is reduced in size so that it fits on the screen/in the window (corresponds to `Down`).
  - *Window size*:Content is enlarged and reduced (corresponds to `Both`).


* **Horizontal alignment**:The options *centered* / *left* / *right* are used to align item content horizontally if the width of the window or screen is greater than the width of the content.


**Vertical alignment**: The options *centered* / *top* / *bottom* are used to align item content vertically if the height of the window or screen is greater than the height of the content.


#### Further settings


* Force suitable screen size**:If *Scale down* or *Window size* is not selected for *Scaling*, this option can be used to force that you can only start task editing if the available size of the window or screen is larger than the required width/height of the items. Otherwise, the following message is displayed: 


> ![](img/screenshot-irtlib-player-message-resolution-too-low-DEU.png){width="80%"}
 


<hr/>Note: The display settings refer to all *survey parts* within a *study*. If several studies are configured in an *IRTlib player*, the settings must match each other, i.e. it is not possible to simultaneously administrate a study in *window mode: window* or in *window mode: full screen* with one instance of an *IRTlib player*.

If changed settings are to be retained, the changes must be saved using the floppy disk symbol. Otherwise, the discard icon can be used:
