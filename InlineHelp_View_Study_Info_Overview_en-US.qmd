### Settings for the Study

- **Name**: How should the *study* be named? Make sure that only letters (upper and lower case), numbers and a `_` are allowed for the name.

- **Description**: This optional field is provided so that you can enter a detailed description of the *study*. Special characters and umlauts etc. can also be entered here.

- **Activate Routing for Survey Parts**: *Studies* consist of one or more *survey parts*. The *survey parts* are administered as a linear sequence by default. If the option *Enable Routing for Survey Parts* is selected, the order of the *Survey Parts* can be defined with *Blockly*-based routing. This enables dynamic sequences of *Survey Parts*, whereby call parameters of the study can also be used, for example, to assign different sequences. 

- **Check screen size**: In surveys where the screen size is not known, this option can be used to compare the size of objects (EC card, banknote, ID card) with representations on the screen.

> If the option *Force Suitable Screen Size* (in the *Display* section) is not activated, test processing can still be started. If the resolution is too small, the following dialogue is displayed:

> Note: This option is currently not configurable.
