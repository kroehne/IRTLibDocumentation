## Runtimes 

The *IRTlib Software* can be used with CBA ItemBuilder tasks of different CBA ItemBuilder versions. The required **Runtime** (i.e., the connection between the CBA ItemBuilder tasks and the *IRTlib Software*) is part of the study configuration so that the *IRTlib Player* knows for sure how to use CBA ItemBuilder tasks of a particular version.
