### Session and end of session

A *session* refers to the execution of a survey with *one* person at *a* specific time. The content displayed in a session corresponds to a configured *study* as it can be created in the *IRTlib Editor*. After all parts of the survey defined in a *study* have been carried out, the *end of session* is reached. 

#### Configuration of the session end 

What happens after a *session end*, i.e. how the *IRTlib Player* behaves at the end of a session, can be defined with the following options:

* **Start new session**: A new session is started. This behavior does not make sense if the login data is passed (either as *startup parameter* or as *URL parameter*).

* Show **end text**: If this option is selected, the platform displays the configured text. The text can be configured as *Message on end page*. 

* **Display end item**: Analogous to a *login item*, a *CBA ItemBuilder* item can also be defined to be displayed at the end of a session. 

> The *End-Item* can finally trigger the termination of the offline *IRTlib Player*. An example of an *end item* with the necessary JavaScript call can be found [here](https://kroehne.github.io/CBAItemBuilderBook/items/9_09/IRTLibEndItemExample.zip).

**Redirect to Exit URL (Redirct to Exit-Url)**: For online deliveries with the *IRTlib Player* it is possible to redirect to a URL. The *redirect URL* can then be configured. 

#### Further options

**Session ID can be reused**: If this option is activated, multiple data captures can be administered with one session ID.
