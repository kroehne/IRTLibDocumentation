### Session and End of Session

A *Session* refers to the execution of a survey with *one* person at *a* specific time. The content displayed in a session corresponds to a configured *Study* as it can be created in the *IRTlib Editor*. After all parts of the survey defined in a *Study* have been carried out, the *End of Session* is reached. 

#### Configuration of the Session End 

What happens after a *Session End*, i.e. how the *IRTlib Player* behaves at the end of a session, can be defined with the following options:

* **Start new Session**: A new session is started. This behaviour is not useful if the login data is transferred (either as *Startup parameter* or as *URL parameter*).

* **Display End Text**: If this option is selected, the platform displays the configured text. The text can be configured as a *Message on End Page*. 

* **Display End Item**: Analogue to a *Login Item*, a *CBA ItemBuilder* item can also be defined to be displayed at the end of a session. 

> The *End-Item* can finally trigger the termination of the offline *IRTlib Player*. An example of an *End Item* with the necessary JavaScript call can be found [here](https://kroehne.github.io/CBAItemBuilderBook/items/9_09/IRTLibEndItemExample.zip).

* **Redirect to Exit URL (Redirect to Exit-Url)**: For online deliveries with the *IRTlib Player* it is possible to redirect to a URL. The *Redirect URL* can then be configured. 

#### Further Options

**Session ID can be Reused**: If this option is activated, multiple data captures can be administered with one session ID.
