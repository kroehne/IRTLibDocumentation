### Configure items

#### Basic functions




**Import *CBA ItemBuilder* project files**:The *IRTlib Editor* maintains a *list of known items* to which *CBA ItemBuilder* project files that are not yet known can be added. To add a project file, first open the *List of known items* with the `+` symbol and then select the *Import* button.

**Update already imported *CBA ItemBuilder* project files**: If a *CBA ItemBuilder* project file is already included in the *List of Known Items*, the project files can be updated. They are then not added to the *List of known items*, but the existing *CBA ItemBuilder* project file is stored in a newer version. To update an item, it must first be selected in the list of items in a *survey section*.This activates the update symbol. In the *Update item* dialog that then opens, an updated version of a *CBA ItemBuilder* project file can be added using the *Import* button.

* **Preview of *CBA ItemBuilder* project files**:Items added in a *survey* section can be viewed directly in the *IRTlib Editor* in a built-in preview function. To view an item, it must first be selected in the list of items in a *survey part*.The *Preview* can then be called up via the eye symbol:

* **Exporting *CBA ItemBuilder* project files**: *CBA ItemBuilder* project files that have been imported into the *IRTlib Editor* can be exported for further editing with the *CBA ItemBuilder*. To export a selected item from the list of items of a *survey part*, the download icon can be called up:

**Deletion of *CBA ItemBuilder* project files**: The items inserted in *survey parts* can be deleted from a *survey part*.The delete symbol removes the item from a *survey part*, but it remains in the *list of known items*:

> Note: It is not yet possible to delete *CBA ItemBuilder* project files from the *List of known items*. This functionality is not necessary because *CBA ItemBuilder* project files are only included in the configuration of a *study* by the *IRTlib Editor* if *tasks* from a *CBA ItemBuilder* project file are used in a *survey* section. 








#### Sorting items (linear process)




* Sorting *CBA ItemBuilder* project files**:If the option *Enable routing* is not selected for a *Survey part*, then the order can be adjusted in the list of items using the following button:

> The items are then administered exactly as they appear for a *survey part* in this list.








Note: Changes to the *Items* view must be saved using the diskette icon or discarded using the undo icon:
