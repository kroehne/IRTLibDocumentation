### Summary of routing between survey parts 

The order of *survey parts* can be defined using *Blockly* (analogous to defining the order of *Items* within *Survey parts*). This option is available if the option *Enable routing for survey parts* is selected in the basic configuration for a study (in the *Overview* view). 

For the general principles of using *Blockly* in the *IRTlib Editor*, see the help on *Routing within survey parts*.

Functions that are only available in *Routing between survey parts* are:


* Display survey part

> ![](img/screenshot-blockly-request-study-part-01-DEU.png){width="200"}

> This *Blockly* operator replaces the *Show Item* within survey parts.

* Successful login

> ![](img/screenshot-blockly-check-login-infinite-study-part-01-DEU.png){width="200"}

> This *Blockly* operator has the value *true* if valid login information was specified before the number of maximum attempts (here: infinite, i.e. unlimited hoft).

Note: Changes to the *Routing* view between *Collection parts* must be saved using the diskette symbol or discarded using the undo symbol:
