### Summary of Routing between Survey Parts 

The order of *Survey Parts* can be defined using *Blockly* (analogue to the definition of the order of *Items* within *Survey Parts*). This option is available if the option *Enable Routing for Survey Parts* is selected in the basic configuration for a study (in the *Overview* view). 

For the general principles of using *Blockly* in the *IRTlib Editor*, see the help on *Routing within Survey Parts*.

Functions that are only available in *Routing between Survey Parts* are:

* Display survey part

> This *Blockly*-operator replaces *Show Item* within *Survey Parts*.

* Successful login

> ![](img/screenshot-blockly-check-login-infinite-study-part-01-DEU.png){width="200"}

> This *Blockly*-operator has the value *true* if valid login information was specified before the maximum number of attempts (here: infinite, i.e. an unlimited number of times).

Note: Changes to the *Routing* view between *Survey Parts* must be saved using the disc symbol or discarded using the undo symbol:
