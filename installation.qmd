# Download & Installation

## Versions

The "IRTLib" software is provided for offline use (Windows) and for online use (Docker Container).

### Offline (Windows)

The IRTLib software (Editor and Player) for offline use can be obtained and downloaded from the releases section of the repository <https://github.com/DIPFtba/IRTlibDeploymentSoftware>.

The section [Releases](https://github.com/DIPFtba/IRTlibDeploymentSoftware/releases) contains the two archives "TestApp.Editor.Desktop.zip" and "TestApp.Player.Desktop.zip" for download.

::: callout-note
Note that currently the latest build can be found in the section [Preview](https://github.com/DIPFtba/IRTlibDeploymentSoftware/releases/tag/preview-231025) of the *Release*-section of the [repository](https://github.com/DIPFtba/IRTlibDeploymentSoftware/releases).
:::

The editor for offline use will be provided as a ZIP archive (e.g., `TestApp.Editor.Desktop.zip`) that needs to be extracted. After extracting the editor, the application `TestApp.Editor.Desktop.exe` can be started on a Windows device.

::: callout-warning
The automatically created preview versions of the IRTLib Editor and Player are not signed. A warning message from the operating system must be accepted before the programs can be executed.
:::

The player is also available as a Windows application for offline use, provided as ZIP-archive (e.g., `TestApp.Player.Desktop.zip`). However, after extracting the player, it requires a published study configuration before the player can be used to collect data. Only after adding content of provided as study configuration of a published study, the executable `TestApp.Player.Desktop.exe` can be started (either with or without startup parameters).

### Online Editor (Docker)

The IRTLib software (editor and player) for online use can be obtained as a docker container. An example is also provided at <https://github.com/DIPFtba/IRTlibDeploymentSoftware>. To use the docker container, it is suggested to check out the repository on the target device (requiring git) and to run the command `./start.sh` inside the folder `docker` (requiring installed `docker` and `docker compose`) to start the software.

When not changed in the file `docker-compose.yml`, the editor is accessible on port *8002* and the player software is accessible on port *8001*.
