## Studies

The *IRTLib Editor* is used to create configurations for studies, which can then be used in an *IRTLib Player* to carry out computer-based assessments.

### How do I get started?

To start configuring a study, click on the plus icon at the bottom right:

Then enter a *name* and optionally a *description* in the **Create new study** dialog.

Make sure that only letters (upper and lower case), numbers and a `_` are allowed for the *name*.

Then click on *Save*.

If required, you can also assign an image to a study using the following icon. This image is used in the *IRTLib Editor* for this study:

- **Change language**: The menu item *Settings* takes you to the item *General settings*, where you can change the language of the *IRTLib Editor*.

This item also gives you access to the *CBA ItemBuilder Runtimes* available in the *IRTLib Editor* (support for the use of *CBA ItemBuilder* content created with different versions of the program).
